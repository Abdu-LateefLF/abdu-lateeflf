## Hi there 👋

I'm Abdu-Lateef Lekan-Fadeyi, a Software Engineering student at the University of Guelph with a passion for ML/AI, full-stack development, and building impactful software solutions. 💡

- 🌱 I’m currently learning machine learning, exploring model optimization, feature engineering, and deployment! 🤖
- 🤔 I recently built a program that classifies political figures from images using machine learning! 🚀 Check it out [here](https://github.com/Abdu-LateefLF/political-figure-classifier)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I started programming at 13! I began by building small games in C# with Unity, and I've been coding ever since. 🎮
- 📫 You can reach me at alekanfa@uoguelph.ca
